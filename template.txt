Level 1:
1- remove unused initialized variables
2- replacing the variable with its expression inside the print statement and remove it's initialization
3- if there is a division on 0 then delete all the code
4- if there is a division on a variable that has the value 0 then delete all the code 

Level 2.1:
1- remove unused initialized variables
2- if the condition is between the same variable : 
    2.1- if the operator is "==" "<=" ">=" then return just its body and delete the other code and delete unused variable.
    2.2- if the operator is "<" ">" "!=" then delete its body and do the same to the else of elif.
    2.3- when we have a not condition then do the opposite. 

Level 3:
1- remove unused initialized variables
2- if the start value >= final value inside the range then delete all the code 
3- if there is a division on 0 then delete all the code
4- if there is a division on a variable that has the value 0 then delete all the code 
5- replace the variable with its expression inside the print statement and remove it's initialization in case:
   3.1- the loop variable != printed variable
   3.2- the loop variable is not a part of the initialization expression of the printed variable
